1. Project Summary

A high-speed medical supply ordering platform designed for hospitals, clinics, and emergency-response units.
This project focuses on ultra-fast ordering workflows, clean interaction logic, and production-ready Figma prototypes.
The system is optimized for critical environments where medical staff must complete orders within seconds.

2. Project Overview

Owvel is a B2B medical procurement system where buyers need to:

Place pre-listed or custom orders instantly

Operate under stress (ICUs, emergency units, labs)

Avoid delays and data-entry mistakes

My role:
Architect the core interaction logic, create end-to-end ordering workflows, and design Figma prototypes used directly by the client’s development team for production.

3. Key Responsibilities

Designed fast, error-proof ordering workflows

Built instant-purchase flows for common hospital items

Created Figma prototypes with clean auto-layout and developer handoff

Reduced unnecessary user steps during emergency scenarios

Optimized UI for clarity, speed, and reliability

4. Core Features Designed
Emergency Ordering Mode

Minimal UI showing only critical categories

Auto-filled delivery info

One-tap quantity presets

Target flow: order completion in 10–20 seconds

Instant Purchase Workflow

Hospital-approved bundles

Smart defaults for quantity & delivery

One-step order confirmation

Dynamic Custom Order Flow

Adapts based on organization type (hospital/lab/clinic)

Learns from user history

Error-proof input fields

7. Tools & Technologies

Figma (high-fidelity prototypes + developer handoff)

UX flow mapping

Interaction design architecture

Process optimization for medical operations

7. Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: Emergency users make errors due to stress
Solution: Reduced UI complexity, added smart defaults & one-tap presets

Challenge: Different organizations require different flows
Solution: Adaptive templates for hospital, lab, and clinic workflows

Challenge: Engineering team needed very precise logic
Solution: Provided annotated interaction flows reused in production

8. Future Improvements

AI-based recurring order prediction

Voice-assisted order creation

Real-time stock visibility + supplier ETA

Offline-first mode for low-connectivity hospitals

9. Status

Project delivered as a core logic + UX architecture module.
The client’s development team used the Figma prototype as the production reference.
