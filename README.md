#Project Summary

A high-speed medical supply ordering platform designed for hospitals, clinics, and emergency response teams.
This project focuses on creating ultra-fast ordering workflows, clean interaction logic, and production-ready
Figma prototypes. The system is optimized for time-critical medical use cases where users must complete orders
within seconds.

#Project Overview

Owvel is a B2B medical procurement platform where buyers need to:
- Place pre-listed or custom medical orders instantly  
- Operate under pressure (critical cases, ICUs, labs, emergency units)  
- Avoid errors and delays

My role was to architect the core interaction logic and design the UI/UX prototypes used by the client’s
development team as the production model.

 #Key Responsibilities

- Designed the end-to-end workflow logic to ensure extremely fast order placement.
- Built instant-purchase flows for pre-listed and customized medical items.
- Created Figma prototypes with clean auto-layout rules and developer annotations.
- Reduced user steps and eliminated unnecessary interactions during emergency orders.
- Optimized screens and flows for clarity, speed, and error prevention.

#Core Features Designed

1. Emergency Ordering Mode
- Minimal UI, only critical categories shown  
- Auto-filled delivery details  
- One-tap quantity presets  
- Designed to complete an order within 10–20 seconds  

2. Instant Purchase Workflow
- Hospital-approved bundles  
- Smart defaults  
- Direct one-step confirmation  

3. Dynamic Custom Order Flow
- Adapts based on user type (hospital/lab/clinic)  
- Learns from previous orders  
- Error-proof data fields

#Tools & Technologies

- Figma (high-fidelity prototype + handoff)  
- UX flow mapping
- Interaction logic architecture 
- Process optimization for medical operations

#Challenges & Solutions (Short Summary)

- Challenge: Emergency users make frequent errors under stress.  
  Solution: Reduced UI complexity and added smart defaults.

- Challenge: Hospitals require different order flows.  
  Solution: Designed adaptive templates based on organization type.

- Challenge: Devs needed very clear logic.  
  Solution: Provided annotated flows and interaction documents reused in production.

#Future Improvements

- AI-based recurring order predictions  
- Voice-based order creation  
- Supplier ETA + real-time stock visibility  
- Offline-first mode for low-connectivity hospitals  

#Status

This project was delivered as a core logic and UX architecture module  
Client’s engineering team used the Figma prototype as the final production reference.
