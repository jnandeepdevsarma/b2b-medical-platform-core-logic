This project involved designing the core interaction logic for a B2B medical supply platform (Owvel). 
The platform is used by hospitals, clinics, labs, and emergency response teams to place rapid medical orders 
under time-critical situations.

The focus of the project was on creating a system where users could complete pre-listed or customized orders 
within seconds. Work included process optimization, Figma UI/UX prototyping, and designing responsive workflows 
for medical buyers handling urgent operational needs.
